The big picture of linear algebra: Four Fundamental Subspaces.

Mathematics is a tool for describing the world around us. Linear equations give some of the simplest descriptions, and systems of linear equations are made by combining several descriptions.

In this unit we write systems of linear equations in the matrix form _Ax = b. We explore how the properties of A_ and b determine the solutions x (if any exist) and pay particular attention to the solutions to _Ax = 0. For a given matrix A_ we ask which b can be written in the form Ax.
